So this is one of my projects where i created a simply weather app. To make it work download all files on your computer. 
Than go to the https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys and if you need create an account.
After login/creating an account go to API Keys tabs and click create api key.
Copy and paste it to the script.js in the right place:
const apiKey = "Your_api";
Start index.html and enjoy.
